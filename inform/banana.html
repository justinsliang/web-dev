        <p>Bananas are probably one of the <strong>greatest</strong> fruits on the planet.
        <br>
        They beat apples in almost every way, and is probably one of the most exquisite fruits to exist.</p>
    <h1> A Brief History </h1>
        <p>One of the more interesting quirks of the banana is how it actually grows on an herb, and the banana itself is actually a berry.
            <br>
            Another thing to not is that the banana we know today is not the banana that we first were introduced to. Throughout history, we have selectively bred and genetically modified
            <br>
            the banana in to becoming the fruit we know today, and for this reason bananas are not only a wonder of biology and human accomplishment, but also a serious biological problem, as 
            <br>
            a serious disease like the Panama fungus may cause all dessert banana plants to die.

    <h1>Some fun facts!</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Bananas are very starchy which is why they make such great food for babies and the elderly</li>
        <li>All of the bananas we usually see (the Cavendish) are biologically identical to each other</li>
        <li>While the most common type of banana in non tropical areas is the dessert banana, plantains (bananas for cooking) are responsible for 85% of all banana production</li>
    </ul>
