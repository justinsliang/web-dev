    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Hello, we are the developers and the owners of this Cat Cafe. The Cat Cafe 
        started in March 2005. We have developed many ways to soothe the mind through 
        the process of playing with animals. We are primarily baseed in New York City, 
        but we also have stores around America. We started when we came up with this great 
        idea that was "recommended" by our Web Application Development Teachers. We were 
        thouroghly inspired to do the job and became a thriving business which we cherish 
        to this day. We have had many editions to our animal family here at Cat Cafe. 
        We created our store and bought adopted cats who didn't have any one to go home to.
        Our Cafe has gone through many hard times that we shouldered through and pushed into 
        the magnificent resteraunt that we are today. Our store is here to help people deal 
        with stress. Many famous people have visited our resteraunt and congradulated us on 
        how good we take care of our animals. Hopefully you enjoy your trip here and come 
        back next time.</p>
